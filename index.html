                <h1>Women's Weird</h1>

                <p><span class="dropCap">O</span>n March 8, 2020, I picked up a copy of <em>Women's Weird</em> - an anthology by Melissa Edmundson of
                    Victorian ghost stories from women authors. Given the significance of the date (International
                    Women's Day), perhaps it was fitting that it caught my eye in the bookstore on that particular day.</p>

                <p> This book would shape the perfect reading list against the backdrop of the strange times that were coming. A
                    week later the global pandemic would shut everything down, and throw the entire world into uncertainty. Though most of the stories are over 100 years old, 
                    the themes in this collection - gloomy atmospheres, 
                    unseen and unexplained dangers, isolation and tension in domestic spheres once considered safe - 
                    were an uncanny parallel to the strange, surreal situation outside.</p>

                <p>The Guardian <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2020/oct/22/unquiet-spirits-the-lost-female-ghost-story-writers-returning-to-haunt-us"><u>featured
                        an article</u></a> discussing this book, and its sequel that was released in October this year.</p>

                                produced was that of having in common one memory so deep and dark that nothing that
                                had happened since was worth either a growl or a wag."</p>

                                commanded me to come to him, as the eyes of the mesmeriser...I was ice-cold with fear
                                and horror, but—I <strong>felt</strong> myself going to him."</em></p>
